            <h2>Lack of Cohesion of Methods</h2>
            <p>The Lack of Cohesion of Methods Metric will help you determine class complexity in terms of how many 
                purposes a single class serves. Ideally, each class should serve a singular purpose for your program. 
                A class with 0 lack of cohesion has no methods, a class with 1 lack of cohesion serves a singular 
                purpose, and a class with greater than 1 lack of cohesion serves multiple purposes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To calculate lack of cohesion, we need to know which attributes of a class each of its methods use. 
                We'll start with each method in its own group. Then we'll combine two groups if they share any of their 
                used attributes, making a new group that uses every attributes its subgroups used. We continue combining 
                groups until all groups have no attributes in common. The number of these remaining groups is our Lack of 
                Cohesion of Methods Metric. There are other more complex versions of this metric, but this tool uses this 
                definition.</p>
