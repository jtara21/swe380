            <h2>Lack of Cohesion of Methods</h2>
                <p>The <b>Lack of Cohesion of Methods Metric</b> will help you determine class complexity in terms of how many 
                    purposes a single class serves. Ideally, each class should serve a singular purpose for your program. 
                    A class with <i>0 lack of cohesion</i> has no methods, a class with <i>1 lack of cohesion</i> serves a singular 
                    purpose, and a class with greater than <i>1 lack of cohesion</i> serves multiple purposes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To calculate lack of cohesion, we need to know which attributes of a class each of its methods use. 
                    We'll start with each method in its own group. Then we'll combine two groups if they share any of their 
                    used attributes, making a new group that uses every attribute its subgroups used. We continue combining 
                    groups until all groups have no attributes in common. The number of these remaining groups is our Lack of 
                    Cohesion of Methods Metric. There are other more complex versions of this metric, but this tool uses this 
                    definition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To use this page of the calculator, simply select "Yes" from the dropdown boxes on the table if the method 
                    for the row utilizes the attribute for the column, or leave it at "No" if the method does not utilize the 
                    attribute.</p>
