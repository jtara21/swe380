            <h2>Response for a Class</h2>
            <p>The Response for a Class Metric will help you determine class complexity in terms of how far your 
                classes' methods reach out to other methods. Simply determine for each method in your classes which  
                methods that particular method calls. The method may call methods from its own class, or from other 
                classes, but make sure you count them all. Enter each called method's name into the table, and let 
                our calculator do the rest.</p>
            <br>
            <p>(The reason we need the specific called methods' names and not just the number of called methods is 
                that you can't double count a called method for a particular class, no matter how many of its methods 
                call that method. Also, some versions of this metric will go even deeper, including methods called by 
                methods called by the methods of the class in question. This tool won't do this.)</p>
