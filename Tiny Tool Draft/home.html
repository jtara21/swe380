            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>If you're curious on what this tool is used for or how to use it, please check out the "Help/Tutorial" 
                    page in the left menu bar. If you'd simply like to begin, head to the Inheritance Page to create some 
                    classes and get started. Then proceed down the line of pages in the navigation bar to add methods and 
                    attributes to your classes and calculate specific CK Metrics. Come back to this page at any time and 
                    click "Display Results" to check your progress!</p>

            	<div class="center">
            		<button id="displayResults" onclick="displayResults()">Display Results</button>
            	</div>
            	<div>

		<p>When you click "Display Results", some of the cells of your table may be highlighted. If they are, that means
			you have a concern that could use addressing. The way you address the concern depends on the particular 
			metric that is causing the concern, so follow these suggestions to improve the design of your program.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>If a cell in the Depth of Inheritance row is highlighted, that means you've created a chain of class inheritance 
		 	that's too long. You can remedy this by splitting some of your inheritance trees apart, or by turning some 
		 	of your child classes into root classes. Interesting note, it's usually the classes in the middle of the 
		 	inheritance tree that pose the most issues, not those deepest in the tree.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>If a cell in the Number of Children row is highlighted, that means that that class has too many children. Consider 
		 	changing up some of its children so they can stand on their own without inheriting from the parent class.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>If a cell in the Weighted Methods per Class row is highlighted, that means your class is too complex. Veer too far
			in this direction and you'll get what we call a "god class". Consider giving some of this class's functionality 
		 	to other classes.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>If a cell in the Lack of Cohesion of Methods row is highlighted, that means one of two things. Either LCM for this 
		 	class is 0 because it has no methods, or LCM for this class is greater than one, which means this class serves 
		 	multiple purposes which are entirely independent of each other. You can remedy this by splitting the class into 
		 	a number of smaller classes equal to its LCM score.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>If a cell in the Reponse for a Class row is highlighted, that means your class calls on a lot of methods. This one 
		 	is a lot less simple to remedy, but you could go one of two ways. You could split the class into smaller classes 
			that individually have less calling to do, but then you run the risk of too many classes. Or you could make each 
		 	method for the class more comphrehensive so that they require less other methods called to function, but then you 
		 	risk your cyclomatic complexities and WMC metric getting too large.</p>
		 <br>
		 <p>If a cell in the Coupling Between Objects row is highlighted, that means your class is collaborating with a lot of your 
		 	other classes. If it collaborates with particular classes a lot, you might consider combining those into one class. If 
		 	it collaborates with many classes only a little each, you might consider splitting the class into multiple smaller classes.</p>
