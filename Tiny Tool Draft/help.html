            <h2>What are the CK Metrics?</h2>
            <p>The Chidamber and Kemerer Metrics, or CK Metrics for short, are a set of metrics designed to help object 
                oriented programmers design efficient systems. To break it down a bit further, metrics are essentially 
                a set of numbers -- or variables if you will -- which you as the software engineer will use our tool to 
                help you calculate. Each of these numbers has an ideal value. Some metrics you want to minimize, some 
                you want to maximize, and some you want to be as close to a specific number as possible.</p>
            <p> But you let us handle that part, all you have to do is plug in some numbers and at the end this tool 
                will give a report on where your design may need adjustment. If you're unsure of where to start, you 
                can follow along with the tutorial below.</p>

            <h2>Tutorial</h2>
            <p>1) The first step to using this tool is to head to the Inheritance Page and create some classes. This 
                page will tell you all about classes and inheritance, but it's up to you to add in the classes for 
                your software. Simply type your class name in the text box, select its parent class (if it has one), 
                and click the "Add Class" button. Do this for each of your classes before moving on to the next step.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2) The second step is to add methods and attributes for each of your classes. Four of the six CK Metrics 
                will require your classes to have methods and attributes. To do this, head to the Methods and Attributes 
                Page. Select a class from the dropdown menu, then click "Add Method" or "Add Attribute" and type in 
                method or attribute names into the boxes that appear. Do this for each of your classes, then proceed.</p>
