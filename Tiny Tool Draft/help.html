            <h2>What are the CK Metrics?</h2>
            <p>The Chidamber and Kemerer Metrics, or CK Metrics for short, are a set of metrics designed to help object 
                oriented programmers design efficient systems. To break it down a bit further, metrics are essentially 
                a set of numbers -- or variables if you will -- which you as the software engineer will use our tool to 
                help you calculate. Each of these numbers has an ideal value. Some metrics you want to minimize, some 
                you want to maximize, and some you want to be as close to a specific number as possible.</p>
            <p> But you let us handle that part, all you have to do is plug in some numbers and at the end this tool 
                will give a report on where your design may need adjustment. If you're unsure of where to start, you 
                can follow along with the tutorial below.</p>
            <!-- Include step-by-step instructions or video tutorials here -->
        </section>
        <section id="tutorial">
            <h2>Tutorial</h2>
            <p>Before you begin this tutorial, we recommend that you open this page in a new window so you can read 
                and work at the same time.</p>
            <br>
            <p>1) The first step to using this tool is to head to the Inheritance Page and create some classes. This 
                page will tell you all about classes and inheritance, but it's up to you to add in the classes for 
                your software. Simply type your class name in the text box, select its parent class (if it has one), 
                and click the "Add Class" button. Do this for each of your classes before moving on to the next step.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2) The second step is to add methods and attributes for each of your classes. Four of the six CK Metrics 
                will require your classes to have methods and attributes. To do this, head to the Methods and Attributes 
                Page. Select a class from the dropdown menu, then click "Add Method" or "Add Attribute" and type in 
                method or attribute names into the boxes that appear. Do this for each of your classes, then click "Save".</p>
            <br>
            <p>3a) The third step is to input information for the remaining four CK Metrics. You can do this in any order, 
                but if you want to follow this tutorial, head to the Weighted Methods per Class Page. If you want to make 
                calculating this metric very easy, you can simply click "Calculate" for each of your classes selected and 
                move on to the next metric. If you want to calculate the more advanced version of this metric, click " Enable 
                Complex Calculation". A table will show each of your class's methods, a dropdown menu to select a different 
                class, along with a column where you can input the methods' cyclomatic complexities. You'll have to find these 
                cyclomatic complexities yourself, and how you calculate cyclomatic complexity is explained on the page for this 
                metric. Determine and input the complexities for the methods of the class, then click "Calculate". You'll see 
                analysis of this metric on the home page. Select a new class and repeat this process for each of your classes, 
                then proceed to the next metric.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3b) For our next metric, head to the Lack of Cohesion of Methods Page. Here you'll see a table of each of your 
                class's methods as the rows, and each of your class's attributes as the columns, with a dropdown menu to select 
                which class you'll be working with. For your first class, think of its methods. Which attributes of that class 
                does each particular method utilize? Each cell of the table is a dropdown box marked "No". Click that box and 
                switch the selection to "Yes" if the method for that row utilizes the attribute of that column. When you're 
                satisfied with the connections between methods and attributes for this class, click "Calculate" to display its 
                Lack of Cohesion of Methods. Again, we'll see analysis of these metrics on the home page. Select a new class and 
                repeat this step for each of of your classes, then proceed to the next metric.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3c) For our next metric, head to the Response for a Class Page. Here you'll see a table of each of your class's 
                methods, a dropdown menu to select which class you'll be working with, and a </p>
            <br>
            <p>3d) For our final metric, head to the Coupling Between Objects Page. Here you'll see two tables with each of your 
                class's methods or attributes as the rows and each of your other classes as the columns, with a dropdown menu 
                to select which class you'll be working with. The cells of each table contain dropdown boxes marked "No". For each 
                of these cells, click them and select "Yes" if the method/attribute of that row collaborates with the class of that 
                column. The page has a description of what collaboration is. Click "Calculate" when you're satisfied with the current 
                collaborations for this class, then repeat the process for each other class.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4) For your final step, head to the Home Page. All you've got to do is click "Display Results", and all of your 
                classes' metrics will be displayed in a table. In addition to this, you'll see below the table a list of potential 
                issues based on your metrics. These will include suggestions for improving your classes.</p>
