            <h2>Methods and Attributes</h2>
            <p>What are attributes and methods? When dealing with object oriented programming, your classes will be composed of attributes and methods, 
                as we call them here. An attribute of a class is a variable or array of variables of the same type that each member of the class 
                has a value for. As an example, a "cat" class may have the attribute "breed", to describe which breed each cat is. The values an 
                attribute takes on aren't relevant for our purposes, but knowing every attribute for the classes you'll be using is vital for 
                determining the Lack of Cohesion of Methods metric for your classes, and can be helpful in understanding your classes and their 
                methods in greater detail. Speaking of methods, the methods of your classes are any function that the class can call. This function 
                can be as simple as telling the user an attribute value for a variable (such as a "getBreed" method for the "cat" class), but 
                they can often be much more complex. Understanding what users of your project can do with the classes you're using (i.e. what their 
                methods are) is key for being able to properly calculate the four non-inheritance CK metrics.</p>
