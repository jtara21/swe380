            <h2>Coupling Between Objects</h2>
            <p>The Coupling Between Objects Metric will help you determine class complexity in terms of how many other 
                classes each class collaborates with. This metric is related to the Response for a Class Metric. 
                Simply determine for each attribute and method in your classes which classes that attribute or method 
                collaborates with. Enter each collaborator class's name into the table, and let our calculator do the 
                rest. In order to determine which classes collaborate, feel free to use Class Responsibility 
                Collaborator Cards (CRC Cards, and example shown below). For the methods, you can also just check in 
                your Response for a Class tables which classes the called methods are from. The Coupling Between 
                Objects metric for a class is the number of unique collaborators for that class.</p>
