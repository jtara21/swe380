    <h2>What are classes and inheritance?</h2>
        <p>In object oriented programming, many of the objects you will be working with will be classes. A class is a 
            unifying set of information about a group of objects, as well as a description of things that those objects 
            can do. As an example, let's say we have a collection of animals. We might create one class named "cat", 
            which describes a cat's breed, size, as well as the ability for the cat to change name, or create more 
            cat objects, among other features (but more on attributes and methods on their own page.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition to classes existing on their own, many classes have a parent class. A parent class passes on 
            all of its information to the child class, but allows additional properties to be added to the child class. 
            With our previous example, perhaps "mammal" is a parent of "cat", because all cats are mammals, but not all 
            mammals are cats. Multiple classes can share a parent class, such as "dog" also being a child of "mammal". 
            And sometimes a class can have multiple parents, which is known as multiple inheritance. This tool doesn't 
            allow for multiple inheritance, but it does allow shared parent classes, as well as multiple "root classes", 
            or classes without parents.</p>
