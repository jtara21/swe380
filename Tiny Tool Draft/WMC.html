            <h2>Weighted Methods per Class</h2>
           <p>The <b>Weighted Methods per Class Metric</b> will help you determine how complex your class is in terms of 
its functionality. There are two versions of this metric that our tool will allow you to use. The 
'<i>Simple Method</i>' just takes a count of how many methods your class has. The '<i>Complex Method</i>' allows 
you to calculate the cyclomatic complexity of each method for your classes and input those values 
into the calculator.</p>
<br>
<p>If you decide to use the '<i>Simple Method</i>', then you have no more work to do for this metric! If you 
decide to use the '<i>Complex Method</i>', you'll need to calculate the cyclomatic complexity for each of 
your classes' methods. For a particular method, you'll need to consider all the possible paths 
that method can take. The cyclomatic complexity then is 2 plus the number of edges minus the 
number of nodes for that method. The nodes are all of the possible lines of code the method might 
run, and the edges are all of the paths between those lines of code. An example of edges and nodes 
is shown below. ADD PICTURE BELOW!!!</p>
