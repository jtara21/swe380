                <h2>Weighted Methods per Class</h2>
                <p>The <b>Weighted Methods per Class Metric</b> will help you determine how complex your class is in terms of 
                    its functionality. There are two versions of this metric that our tool will allow you to use. The 
                    '<i>Simple Calculation</i>' just takes a count of how many methods your class has. The '<i>Complex Calculation</i>' 
                    allows you to calculate the cyclomatic complexity of each method for your classes and input those values 
                    into the calculator.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>If you decide to use the '<i>Simple Calculation</i>', then you have no more work to do for this metric! Simply 
                     click "Calculate" for each of your classes and move on. If you decide to use the '<i>Complex Calculation</i>', 
                     you'll need to calculate the cyclomatic complexity for each of your classes' methods. For a particular method, 
                     you'll need to consider all the possible paths that method can take. The cyclomatic complexity then is 2 plus 
                     the number of edges minus the number of nodes for that method. The nodes are all of the possible sections of 
                     code the method might run, and the edges are all of the paths between those sections of code. An example of 
                     using edges and nodes to calculate cyclomatic complexity is shown below.</p>
