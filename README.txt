SWE380 Tiny Tool - Object-Oriented Metrics
Tool Created By: Jesse Anderson, Aminata Diop, Julia Taratuta, and Trevor Heydt

Hello! This document is here to help you run this program. If you're looking for information on how to use the tool itself, 
you'll find that on the "Help/Tutorial" Page of the program.

The unzipped folder containing this file also contained a folder called "Tiny Tool Draft". In here is all of the important code for the program.
Inside of the "Tiny Tool Draft" folder is a script.js file and a main_style.css file. These files contain the code that gives the program its
functionality and its aesthetic stylings respectively. There is also a folder within this folder labeled "Images", which contains all necessary 
.png files for the program to display. 

Finally, there are eight .html files in the "Tiny Tool Draft" folder. These files create the eight pages of the program for you as the user 
to navigate between. In order to launch the program, you'll need to open a particular one of these .html files, the "home.html" file. Simply run 
this file, and the program should open in your default browser. From there you can get started on calculating your metrics using the program.

Again, if you have any questions about how to use the tool, launch the program, then use the navigation bar on the left of the page to get to the 
"Help/Tutorial" Page, which explains how to use the program in detail.

One more note, the program doesn't have any long term storage. This means that if you close the program (or the program crashes) and then re-launch it,
you won't keep any of your data from before the program closed.
